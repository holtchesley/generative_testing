# Generative Testing

This is slides and examples of a brief introduction to generative testing that I gave while attending Recurse Center. 

The slides can be viewed by `npm install;npm start` in the slides folder. 

The tests in each of the folders fail in some cases if you'd like to run them and fix the code yourself as practice.
